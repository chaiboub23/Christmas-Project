# Design

## Materials
* 1 Box that can fit all the materials inside (At least 5-6 inches wide)
* 1 Spring 1 inch taller than the box and 1-3 inches in diameter
* 2 Alligator Clips
* 2 Magnets that can attach to each other
* 1 Microbit
* 1 Battery Pack for the Microbit
* Headphones or Speaker
* Electrical Tape

## Instructions

1. Make sure that the top of the box is empty.

2. Get a piece of cardboard that can cover the top of the box. Tape one side to the box to cover the top.

3. Take a spring and glue it using a hot glue gun inside the bottom of the box.

4. Glue one magnet inside the box near the top of the box. The magnet should be opposite to the hinge of the top cover.

5. Glue another magnet underneath the top cover so that it aligns to the other magnet when the cover is closed.

7. Cut two tiny holes, just big enough so that you can put both buttons of the Microbit can fit.

8. Connect the two alligator clips to the 0 and GND pins on the Microbit and connect the Microbit to a battery pack. Place Microbit inside the box. The buttons should fit inside the two holes and stay in place.

9. Connect the alligator clips to a headphone jack so that the ground alligator clip is on top of other one.

10. Tape the back of the Microbit so that it rests secure.

Now you should have a working toy.
